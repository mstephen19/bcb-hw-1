# Code Refactor

In this project, I refactored the "Horiseon" website's HTML and CSS files. Originally, there were a lot of unsemantic elements being used, which I replaced with various semantic HTML elements that served the same function, yet provided better accessibility. In the CSS file, there were a lot of unnecessary repetitions of the same styles, as well as a lot of unnecessary classes. These were also fixed and consolodated. Finally, there was a broken button, so that got fixed as well.
